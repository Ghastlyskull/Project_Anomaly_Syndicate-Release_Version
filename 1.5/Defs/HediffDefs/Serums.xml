        <label>ghoul awakening</label>
        <description>A mixture of deadlife dust and advanced biochemicals course through this creatureâ€™s veins that temporarily restores mental clarity in ghouls. Once administered, it reactivates dormant neural pathways, allowing ghouls to regain full cognitive function for a short period. Under its effects, ghouls experience a brief return to their former selves. However, as the serum wears off, they gradually slip back into their instinct-driven state.</description>
